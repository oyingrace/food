<p>Always use equal parts rice and water; let steam do the work. Reason being that Jollof should be infused with steam, not boiled.&nbsp; The more you are able to infuse your rice without overcooking, the tastier it is. If you boil jollof on super high heat, it’s pretty much mixed rice and stew <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . To ensure that the steam stays in the pot, I cover with foil then a tight fitting lead and cook on medium-low heat . People didn’t really understand when&nbsp;I first shared this tip in 2012, I am happy to see that it’s now the norm.</p>
<h2 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="27.12px"><strong>Color</strong></h2>
<p>There are two major determining factors for jollof color. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>properly fried base and</li>
<li>tomato paste (purée) .</li>
</ol>
<p>I use one heaped tablespoon of paste per 2 fresh tomatoes. If you don’t like canned paste, you can make it yourself or substitute&nbsp; paprika. I also do something which I call the paper towel test.</p>
<h2 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="27.12px"><strong>Cook&nbsp;</strong>/&nbsp;<strong>Texture</strong></h2>
<p>Texture of jollof is just as important as the taste. You never want the rice to turn to mush, yet you don’t want undercooked rice. If you are ever in a sticky situation, here are some tips:</p>
<p>1. Too Much Water But Good Texture: If there is too much water in your Jollof, but the texture is just right. Transfer the rice to a wider pot (if possible), increase the heat to maximum and leave UNCOVERED. The water will evaporate quickly.<br />
2. Too Much Water and Soggy: If your rice looks like it might get soggy, DON’T leave it in the pot. You want to cool it down as fast as possible in order to stop the cooking process. Spread it out on an oven tray and place in a cool place like an open fridge (don’t close the fridge oh, all that condensation will pull on your food) to cool down . Toss the cooled rice in the oven to completely dry out.<br />
3. Undercooked Rice:&nbsp;If the water is all dry in the pot but the rice isn’t quite done:</p>
<p><strong>is it burning?</strong>&nbsp;If yes- add 1 tablespoon of boiling water for every cup of rice in the pot. COVER TIGHTLY. Increase heat for about 1 minute (this is to bring the water to the right temperature) immediately turn off the heat, switch the rice to a different burner that isn’t warm, leave covered for 10-20 minutes depending on the size of your rice.</p>
<p><strong>Not burning</strong>&nbsp;– Turn off the heat but leave the rice covered for another 8-10 minutes, the retained heat and steam will continue to cook the rice.</p>
<h2 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="27.12px"><strong>Taste</strong></h2>
<p>The unique taste of jollof comes from the cooking technique as well as basic seasonings and spices. General flavor profile of&nbsp; jollof has Bayleaf, tomato, onion, bouillon (maggi), curry, thyme and salt. I have seen very old West African cookbooks with unique ingredients like nutmeg.&nbsp; I also know some west African countries put ginger and garlic in theirs. It’s&nbsp;up to you to find the flavour pairing you enjoy the most, make sure the basics are included and build on those flavors. Also, do not be afraid to add more seasonings and spices after the rice is cooked, just make sure&nbsp;your rice is&nbsp;still hot when you do.</p>
<h2 class="fusion-responsive-typography-calculated" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="27.12px"><strong>Pairing</strong></h2>
<p>The jollof experience is often as important as what it’s paired with. Jollof is NEVER served alone. A perfectly paired plate of jollof should include two or more of the follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried plantain (obviously)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.9jafoodie.com/nigerian-peppered-meat/">Sauced or stewed meat</a></li>
<li>&nbsp;Creamy coleslaw is always a great idea</li>
<li><a href="https://www.9jafoodie.com/moi-moi-recipe-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moimoi</a></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many parents place a high priority on the nutritional quality of the meal. Don’t get me wrong, this is important.</p>
<p>However, family style meal service offers other important benefits to children.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Children Develop Better Motor Skills (Gross and Fine Motor)</strong></h3>
<p>The act of balancing platters and bowls, passing them to the left or right, and scooping food, for example, builds on a child’s existing gross and fine motor skills.</p>
<p>Of course, children need practice to become skilled in this area.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Not only do mealtimes with adults offer the support and guidance children need to become more skillful in this area, kids are also cultivating autonomy and self-esteem from learning.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Kids Make Independent Food Decisions</strong></h3>
<p>Family-style service allows your child to choose what she wants to eat (from what you’re serving), and allows her to determine how much she’ll put on her plate.</p>
<p>There’s great learning from making your own plate of food. Maybe your child puts too much on her plate (overserving), or not enough (underserving).</p>
<p>Over time, she’ll learn more about her appetite and body, and be able to serve herself the right amount of food.</p>
<p>A bonus: This method discourages you from being over-involved in your child’s eating, while honoring the individual food preferences and eating style of your child.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Children Try New Foods, Without the Pressure</strong></h3>
<p>For new eaters or picky eaters, family style dining creates an easy exposure to new foods.</p>
<p>Just seeing, smelling and passing food around the table engages the senses, which is one of the first steps to trying new foods.</p>
<p>Plus, ditching the pre-plating method (when you put all the food on the plate first and give it to your child) may encourage children to try new tastes simply because the pressure to eat is off.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Kids Can Practice Table Manners</strong></h3>
<p>During family mealtime, children can learn and&nbsp;<a href="https://thenourishedchild.com/kids-develop-table-manners/">practice table manners</a>, such as ‘please,’ ‘thank you,’ and other courtesies.</p>
<p>As kids hone their motor skills, they also learn to carefully pass, be watchful of spilling, and other polite actions towards others at the table.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that waiting for food and others to pass it teaches patience and gratitude.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Families Cultivate Connection, Conversation and Fun at the Table</strong></h3>
<p>I believe family meals, in general, are key to a connected family.</p>
<p>Serving meals family-style enhances this further by taking the focus off of eating a certain amount or cleaning the plate.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Rather, parents come to understand that children are in charge of what and how much they eat, and parents are in charge of making balanced, nutritious meals and keeping mealtimes positive.</p>
<h2><strong>What Can I Serve at a Family-Style Meal?</strong></h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Any meal can be served family style! There aren’t any special recipes for this. It’s more about laying out the menu items on the table and letting your child pick and choose based on what’s there.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to serve a balanced, nutritious meal that includes most of the food groups, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein foods</li>
<li>Whole grains</li>
<li>Dairy</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
</ul>
