<h2 class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">SOY MILK RECIPE</h2>
<p>Soy milk is a great alternative to animal milk. It&#8217;s delicious, can be made at home affordably and easily, and it&#8217;s so simple. Just soybeans and water. Of course, we like to do all kinds of fun things with our soy milk like make&nbsp;<a href="https://culturesforhealth.com/blogs/learn/yogurt-how-to-make-non-dairy-yogurt">dairy-free yogurt</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://culturesforhealth.com/blogs/recipes/soy-recipe-homemade-tofu">tofu</a>, but it&#8217;s also fantastic just to drink.</p>
<h3 class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">SUPPLIES FOR MAKING&nbsp;<b>HOMEMADE</b>&nbsp;SOY MILK:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Container for soaking beans &#8211; You can use any container that holds 4 or more cups, but we like to use&nbsp;<a href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/32-ounce-mason-jar">32 oz. Mason Jars</a>.</li>
<li>Blender &#8211; As long as the beans are well-soaked, most blenders will work perfectly fine.</li>
<li>Strainer &#8211;&nbsp; Cheesecloth, like our fine-meshed&nbsp;<a href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/butter-muslin">Butter Muslin Cheesecloth</a>, works fine, but we haven&#8217;t found anything more convenient than these&nbsp;<a href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/organic-cotton-nut-milk-bag-1">Organic Cotton Nut Milk Bags</a>.</li>
<li>Heavy-bottom Pan &#8211; A thin pan doesn&#8217;t disperse heat as evenly and can lead to scorching.<br />
<h3 class="ingredients">INGREDIENTS FOR&nbsp;MAKING SOY MILK AT HOME:</h3>
<p>If you like, you can add various things to your soy milk like a little sugar, some agave nectar, a pinch of salt, or even something a little more interesting like cinnamon or cocoa. You are going to want to use yellow soybeans as they make the best soy milk.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="volume">½ cup soybeans</span></li>
<li><span class="volume">2-3 cups water for soaking</span></li>
<li><span class="volume">4 cups water for blending</span></li>
<li><span class="volume">Sugar to taste (optional)</span><br />
<h3>SOY MILK RECIPE INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Soak&nbsp;</strong>soybeans in 2-3 cups of water&nbsp;<strong>overnight.</strong>&nbsp;This will soften the soybeans and get them ready for blending.</li>
<li><strong>Discard</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;water and&nbsp;<strong>rinse</strong>&nbsp;soybeans. We want to get rid of any of the dirt or contaminants that were on the beans themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Remove</strong>&nbsp;skins as best you can. You can rub the beans by hand while they&#8217;re underwater. The released skins will float to the top and can be skimmed off. Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t get them all. Blending the beans will release all that soy nutrition.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong>&nbsp;soybeans and 4 cups water to a blender.</li>
<li><strong>Blend</strong>&nbsp;until smooth. This step exposes the entire bean to the water, ensuring we wring all the nutrition we can from these beans for our homemade soy milk.</li>
<li><strong>Strain</strong>&nbsp;the blended mixture using&nbsp;<a title="Butter Muslin for Soft Cheesemaking" href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/butter-muslin?banner=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheesecloth</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a title="Organic Cotton Nut Milk Bag" href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/organic-cotton-bag-10-12-inch?banner=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nut milk bag</a>. Our testing has led us to these&nbsp;<a title="Organic Cotton Nut Milk Bag" href="https://culturesforhealth.com/products/organic-cotton-bag-10-12-inch?banner=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">organic cotton nut milk bags</a>. They&#8217;re a great balance of tightly woven cloth that keeps the pulp inside, porous enough to let the milk flow freely, tough enough to withstand multiple milkings, and with a tie-close top that prevents blowouts.</li>
<li><strong>Heat</strong>&nbsp;the strained milk in a heavy-bottom pan to 212ºF (100ºC).&nbsp;<strong>Hold&nbsp;</strong>this temperature for&nbsp;<strong>20 minutes</strong>, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.&nbsp;<strong>Cool</strong>&nbsp;the milk and store. This is an important step since, as a legume, soy can&#8217;t be consumed raw.</li>
<li><strong>Refrigerate</strong>&nbsp;up to 4 days.</li>
<li>
<div class="instructions">
<h2>VARYING YOUR SOY MILK RECIPE</h2>
<p>Soy milk is a delicious and variable product all by itself, but if you want to, you can really amp up the flavor of your soy milk with a few simple additions. Try adding any of the following to your soy milk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add cocoa powder and a little sweetener while your soy milk is hot</li>
<li>Blend soy milk with the fruit of your choice</li>
<li>Blend with cinnamon</li>
<li>Add a sweetener like honey, agave or maple syrup</li>
<li>Add a splash of vanilla</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="after-content">
<h2>WHY&nbsp;MAKE SOY MILK AT HOME</h2>
<p>Homemade soy milk is a great alternative milk for making yogurt. You can also use it for&nbsp;making homemade tofu&nbsp;or in&nbsp;non-dairy yogurt recipes. Cultures for Health is your one-stop shop for all things fermentation and cultures and that includes making your own soy milk! From&nbsp;all the tools you need&nbsp;to multiple different&nbsp;all-in-one kits that have everything you need to start making your own food at home, we have it all and take all the guesswork out of navigating the fermentation world.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many parents place a high priority on the nutritional quality of the meal. Don’t get me wrong, this is important.</p>
<p>However, family style meal service offers other important benefits to children.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Children Develop Better Motor Skills (Gross and Fine Motor)</strong></h3>
<p>The act of balancing platters and bowls, passing them to the left or right, and scooping food, for example, builds on a child’s existing gross and fine motor skills.</p>
<p>Of course, children need practice to become skilled in this area.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Not only do mealtimes with adults offer the support and guidance children need to become more skillful in this area, kids are also cultivating autonomy and self-esteem from learning.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Kids Make Independent Food Decisions</strong></h3>
<p>Family-style service allows your child to choose what she wants to eat (from what you’re serving), and allows her to determine how much she’ll put on her plate.</p>
<p>There’s great learning from making your own plate of food. Maybe your child puts too much on her plate (overserving), or not enough (underserving).</p>
<p>Over time, she’ll learn more about her appetite and body, and be able to serve herself the right amount of food.</p>
<p>A bonus: This method discourages you from being over-involved in your child’s eating, while honoring the individual food preferences and eating style of your child.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Children Try New Foods, Without the Pressure</strong></h3>
<p>For new eaters or picky eaters, family style dining creates an easy exposure to new foods.</p>
<p>Just seeing, smelling and passing food around the table engages the senses, which is one of the first steps to trying new foods.</p>
<p>Plus, ditching the pre-plating method (when you put all the food on the plate first and give it to your child) may encourage children to try new tastes simply because the pressure to eat is off.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Kids Can Practice Table Manners</strong></h3>
<p>During family mealtime, children can learn and&nbsp;<a href="https://thenourishedchild.com/kids-develop-table-manners/">practice table manners</a>, such as ‘please,’ ‘thank you,’ and other courtesies.</p>
<p>As kids hone their motor skills, they also learn to carefully pass, be watchful of spilling, and other polite actions towards others at the table.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that waiting for food and others to pass it teaches patience and gratitude.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Families Cultivate Connection, Conversation and Fun at the Table</strong></h3>
<p>I believe family meals, in general, are key to a connected family.</p>
<p>Serving meals family-style enhances this further by taking the focus off of eating a certain amount or cleaning the plate.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Rather, parents come to understand that children are in charge of what and how much they eat, and parents are in charge of making balanced, nutritious meals and keeping mealtimes positive.</p>
<h2><strong>What Can I Serve at a Family-Style Meal?</strong></h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-content="true">Any meal can be served family style! There aren’t any special recipes for this. It’s more about laying out the menu items on the table and letting your child pick and choose based on what’s there.</p>
<p>I’d encourage you to serve a balanced, nutritious meal that includes most of the food groups, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein foods</li>
<li>Whole grains</li>
<li>Dairy</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Vegetables</li>
</ul>
